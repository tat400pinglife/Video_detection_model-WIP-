# AI_video_detection_Model

Session #1: setup\
Created dedicated conda environment, fully portable with yml file\
Starting testing frame extraction with temportal and frequency techniques\
No GPU implementation as of yet, future plans to use google cloud server or remote GPU server  \
Feel free to try to use your own nvidia cards, I only have AMD :p\

Session #2: creating model algorithm and sourcing data\
Created sample data and finsihed frame analysis script and modified to not save frames\
Script now saves data into tensors with data labels\
Still need to implement the model and try with big dataset\
currently do not have the space or resources to load in vidbench data\
Will need to look into usng profesors remote servor or buy external harddisk or SSD\
(probably not buying with these prices going up tho ...)\
Note to self: check if frames are sufficient\
