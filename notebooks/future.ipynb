    "Artifact detection is currently inaccurate with a minimal loss of around 30% for 60 epochs. This is expected with the current limited training scope and how aggresive the artifacts its been trained on are. Another nitpick is the temporal analysis per frame, which is performing well in determining a good percentage of the final decision. But doesn't match with the artifact detection on certain frames. Later implementations might find a way for the branches to converge or merge to show some kind of output which highlights suspicious blurring, cutting, or any other temporal glitches that can be found. This is somewhat similar to the first initial build."
